## Overview
This repository provides instructions on setting up a local language model (LLM) environment with a focus on privacy, cost-efficiency, and learning. The instructions below will guide you through the process of installing an LLM and setting up a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) environment locally.

## Key Topics
**1. Privacy:** To ensure that sensitive or private information is not disclosed by hosting the language model locally.

**2. Cost Efficiency:** To reduce the running costs associated with maintaining a service by running it locally rather than using cloud-based services.

**3. Learning:** To gain knowledge on how to install and configure a language model locally and implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup.
## How to install
### Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

**Hardware:** A suitable machine with sufficient RAM and CPU capabilities to run the language model. Minimum requirements will be specified in the installation instructions.

**Software:** Basic understanding of command line interfaces (CLI), Docker, and Python (if applicable).
### Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the local language model environment:

**Step 1:** Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

**Step 2:** Install Dependencies
Install necessary dependencies and tools required for running the LLM. This might include Docker, Python libraries, or specific system packages.

**Step 3:** Configure Environment Variables
Set up any required environment variables for configuring the language model. Refer to config.example.yml or similar files provided in the repository.

**Step 4:** Initialize the LLM
